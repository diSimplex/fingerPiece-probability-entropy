# A look at Probability and Entropy

A look at Probability and Entropy as it will be used in the diSimplex
project, using ideas from Cox, as well as Peter Wally.

Using ideas originally expounded by
[Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Threlkeld_Cox),
[Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) and then
Halpern, we look at the logical approach to Probability and Entropy.

We generalise these ideas to work with any(?) (appropriate?) lattice.

We can then further generalise these ideas to the lattice of lattices...
to obtain something similar to Peter Walley's Imprecise Probability.
